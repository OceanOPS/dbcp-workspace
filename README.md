## 💡 Editing

You can safely edit `.html`, `.css`, or `.js` files directly.  
All links should remain **relative** (e.g., `./pages/about.html`) to ensure compatibility with the OceanOPS hosting environment.

For consistency:
- Keep filenames lowercase with no spaces.  
- Avoid large or uncompressed images.  
- Test locally by simply opening `index.html` in your browser.
